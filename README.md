These guidelines build on Apple's existing [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html).
Unless explicitly contradicted below, assume that all of Apple's guidelines apply as well.

_This styleguide is based on [GitHub's Objective-C conventions](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions), but we don't agree on everything :)_

## Whitespace

* Indent blocks using 4 spaces
* Activate "Automatically trim trailing whitespace" and "Including whitespace-only lines" in Xcode settings -> Text Editing.
* Make liberal use of vertical whitespace to divide code into logical chunks.
* Blocks are separated by one, and only one, empty line.

## Documentation and Organization

* All method declarations should be documented using the [AppleDoc](github.com/tomaz/appledoc) standard.
* Comments should be hard-wrapped at 80 characters.
* Use `#pragma mark`s to categorize methods into functional groupings and protocol implementations, following this general structure:

```objc
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#pragma mark - TABLE VIEW DELEGATE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

* Use the same groupings in header files, but format them according as AppleDoc:

```objc
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @name Table View Delegate
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Declarations

* Always prefer properties to ivars.
* Prefer exposing an immutable type for a property if it being mutable is an implementation detail. This is a valid reason to declare an ivar for a property.
* Don't use `@synthesize` unless the compiler requires it. Note that optional properties in protocols must be explicitly synthesized in order to exist.
* Instance variables should be prefixed with an underscore (just like when implicitly synthesized).
* Don't put a space between an object type and the protocol it conforms to.

```objc
@property (attributes) id<Protocol> object;
```
 
* C function declarations should have no space before the opening parenthesis, and should be namespaced just like a class.

```objc
void NMAwesomeFunction(BOOL hasSomeArgs);
```

## Expressions

* Don't access an ivar unless you're in `-init`, `-dealloc` or a custom accessor.
* Use dot-syntax for getters, but not setters:

```objc
[self.manager setDelegate:self];
```

* Use object literals, boxed expressions, and subscripting over the older, grosser alternatives.
* Comparisons should be explicit for everything except `BOOL`s.
* Prefer positive comparisons to negative.
* Long form ternary operators should be wrapped in parentheses and only used for assignment and arguments.

```objc
Blah *a = (stuff == thing ? foo : bar);
```

* Short form, `nil` coalescing ternary operators should avoid parentheses.

```objc
Blah *b = thingThatCouldBeNil ?: defaultValue;
```

* There shouldn't be a space between a cast and the variable being cast.

```objc
NewType a = (NewType)b;
```

## Control Structures

* Always surround `if` bodies with curly braces.
* All curly braces should begin on the same line as their associated statement. They should end on a new line.
* Else statements should begin on a new line.
* Put a single space after keywords and before their parentheses.
* Return and break early.
* No spaces between parentheses and their contents.

```objc
if (something == nil) {
    // do stuff
}
else {
    // do other stuff
}
```

## Literals

* Avoid making numbers a specific type unless necessary (for example, prefer `5` to `5.0`, and `5.3` to `5.3f`).
* The contents of array and dictionary literals should have a space on both sides.
* Dictionary literals should have no space between the key and the colon, and a single space between colon and value.

```objc
NSArray *numbers = @[ @1, @2, @3 ];
NSDictionary *prefs = @{ @"FollowConventions": @YES };
```

* Longer or more complex literals should be split over multiple lines (and never have a terminating comma):

```objc
NSArray *theShit = @[
    @"Lorem ipsum and stuff...",
    @"And the quick brown fox",
    @"They should be friends"
];
```

## Categories

* Categories should be named for the sort of functionality they provide.
